                        <ul class="answers">
                            <li>Poor user feedback - Buttons are not tacktile, and the sound is not very loud</li>
                            <li>Quick time only on first 5 buttons - Requires user extra steps for longer cooking</li>
                            <li>Low options - The top quick options are limited, and require figuring out to use</li>
                            <li>Multiple button sequence to enter percisely - If you want a specific time you must add
                                extra buttons to finish your task</li>
                            <li>No explinations/information - The only guide is inside the microwave door, and is very
                                basic</li>
                            <li>Power level entry - Requires entry of allowed power level, instead of cycling through
                                options</li>
                            <li>No back button - If you make a mistake, you must restart</li>

                        <h3>Common/Rare Uses</h3>
                        <ul class="answers">
                            <li>Common - Reheating/Warming food - Interface allows for quick heating through quick
                                buttons, but takes longer for specific time entry/power change</li>
                            <li>Common - Melting ingredients(Butter, Sauce...etc) - The shorter quick options(1min/3sec)
                                aid in quick entry</li>
                            <li>Common - Use as kitchen timer - Doesn't allow quick entry, so you are required to hit
                                more buttons</li>
                            <li>Common - Heating/Boiling water for tea/coco - Quick options allow easy entry, but a
                                option for liquids would make it more convenient </li>
                            <li>Rare - Defrosting food - Have to look inside the microwave for the correct option to
                                enter</li>
                        </ul>

                        <ul class="answers">
                            <li>Hit quick time option -> wait for timer to expire -> hit door open button -> done</li>
                            <li>Hit time cook -> enter percise time -> hit start -> wait for timer to expire -> hit door
                                open button -> done</li>
                            <li>Use as timer -> hit kitchen timer -> enter percise time -> hit start -> wait for timer
                                to expire -> hit cancel/esc -> done </li>

                        <h3>User Support</h3>
                        <ul class="answers">
                            <li>This microwave has a small sheet on how to use inside the microwave, but doesnâ€™t cover
                                all of the functions (Only the reheat snack button/basic time entry). So as a user I had
                                to figure out the power level, defrost, cook,
                                and reheat functions. This took time of basically hitting random buttons until something
                                happened. Then as a user you are required to remember thease sequences for next time.
                                Since I do not use these functions often, I have forgotten how to utilize them. So next
                                time I will have to use trial/error again.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <h3>User Feedback</h3>
                        <ul class="answers">
                            <li>Sound - Sound is the only feedback you recieve with the above microwave. This requires
                                the user to listen for an auditory response to their actions.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <h3>Common User Mistakes</h3>
                        <ul class="answers">
                            <li>Entering the wrong time - Since the time is entered right->left and there is no back
                                button, the user has to stop and restart to enter the corrected time.</li>
                            <li>Not using correct power setting - The power setting is not listed on the screen, so as a
                                user you have to double check on your own. I have use too low/high of a power setting a
                                few times.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <img src="LowPrototype.jpg" alt="">
                        <ul class="answers">
                            <li>Simplistic design, go left to right to complete any function. Set time, power, mode, and
                                then start. Once done, open.</li>
                            <li>Easily able to edit errors since each digit is imputted individually.</li>
                            <li>Easily able to change power level.</li>
                            <li>Quick settings allow for any time entry, and addition of 30 seconds easily.</li>
                            <li>Color blind mode will toggle through differeny color sets to allow visually impaired to
                                still utilize the microwave.</li>
                            <li>Deaf mode will flash the touch screen at a rate of 2HZ to alert the user, instead of
                                using sound as the alert.</li>
                            <li>Silent mode allows for use of microwave at night or when needing to be quite.</li>
                            <li>The main functions are also enlarged versus normal microwave, this allows visual
                                impaired to use without struggle.</li>

                    <li>Color blind mode - Will toggle through various color sets so the user can tailor their
                        experience.</li>
                    <li>Deaf mode - The microwave will flash when complete instead of sound to accommodate hearing
                        impairment.</li>
                    <li>Enlarged functions - Allow visually impaired to use the microwave without struggling</li>
                    <li>Silent mode - Some mental illnesses are heightened when loud noises so turning off the alert may
                        aid from causing strain.</li>
